# CryptoC

Testing assignment for Sannacode Company.
Using some API fetch and show in the table crypto currencies and its values in USD. With possibility calculating and converting currencies in detail view.

Probably take a bit more time that I think because I want to do as clean app as I can. Devil in the details.
Also I added some functionality like Search Currency.
